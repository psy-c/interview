The research data set will have no identifier other than the hash. Assume\nthis \"anonymized\" data set could one day appear in a data breach. A hash generated for a record number today should be identical to a hash generated for the same record number years from now, so that the researcher can keep track of a patient's health over time and see which rows of the data set belong to the same patient. At the same time, it should not be easy for an attacker to map a hash back to the record number by knowing the name of of the hash function alone.
